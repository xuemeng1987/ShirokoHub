# Hi there!
It's me, your dad! (Just kidding.)

Hello, I'm Shiroko (formerly known as Miya253).  
Welcome to my README!

Here, you'll find my current and past projects, like Project Zero (though, honestly, that one hasn’t seen updates in forever).  
And there’s my current website... oh, where did the previous site go? (Just testing to see if anyone noticed, really.)

If you’re curious about me or my work, feel free to connect with me on Discord!  
My Discord handle is **miya253** — come say hi (or pick a friendly fight).

Enjoy your stay!
